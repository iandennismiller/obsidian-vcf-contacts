# VCard Format Guide

## Understanding vCard (.vcf) Format

The VCF Contacts plugin uses the industry-standard vCard 4.0 format to store contact information. This ensures compatibility with virtually all contact management systems.

## What is vCard?

vCard is an electronic business card format that contains contact information in a standardized way. It's supported by:

- Email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Phone contact apps (iOS Contacts, Android Contacts)
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Address book applications

## File Structure

Each contact in your vault consists of:

1. **Markdown file** (e.g., `John Doe.md`) - The main contact note
2. **Frontmatter section** - Contains vCard-compliant contact data
3. **Content area** - Your notes, links, and thoughts about the contact

## Example Contact Format

```markdown

| | | `RELATED[colleague]: uid:custom-id` |

## Field Indexing

For fields that can have multiple values (like phone numbers or emails), use index numbers:

```yaml
EMAIL[1]: primary@example.com      # Primary email
EMAIL[2:WORK]: work@company.com    # Work email
EMAIL[3:HOME]: home@personal.com   # Home email

TEL[1:CELL]: +1-555-123-4567      # Mobile
TEL[2:WORK]: +1-555-987-6543      # Work phone
TEL[3:HOME]: +1-555-111-2222      # Home phone
```

## Type Labels

Common type labels for categorizing information:

### Phone Types

- `CELL`, `MOBILE` - Mobile phone
- `WORK` - Work phone  
- `HOME` - Home phone
- `FAX` - Fax number
- `PAGER` - Pager

### Email Types

- `WORK` - Work email
- `HOME` - Personal email
- `OTHER` - Other email

### Address Types

- `HOME` - Home address
- `WORK` - Work address
- `OTHER` - Other address

### URL Types

- `WORK` - Work website
- `HOME` - Personal website
- `OTHER` - Other website

## Advanced Features

### Relationship Tracking

The plugin supports relationship tracking between contacts using the vCard 4.0 RELATED field:

#### RELATED Field Format

```yaml
RELATED[friend]: urn:uuid:03a0e51f-d1aa-4385-8a53-e29025acd8af
RELATED[colleague]: uid:some-custom-uid
RELATED[sibling]: name:Jane Doe
```

The RELATED field value uses three possible namespace formats:

1. **`urn:uuid:`** - Preferred format when the contact's UID is a valid UUID
   - Example: `urn:uuid:03a0e51f-d1aa-4385-8a53-e29025acd8af`
   - Used for unambiguous reference to contacts by their UUID

2. **`uid:`** - Used when the contact has a unique identifier that is not a valid UUID
   - Example: `uid:custom-identifier-123`
   - Used when UID exists and is unique but doesn't follow UUID format

3. **`name:`** - Used when the target contact doesn't exist in Obsidian yet
   - Example: `name:First Last`
   - Allows forward references to contacts not yet created

#### Multiple Relationships of the Same Type

When you have multiple relationships of the same type (forming a set), the plugin uses indexed keys:

```yaml
RELATED[friend]: urn:uuid:first-friend-uuid       # First friend
RELATED[1:friend]: urn:uuid:second-friend-uuid    # Second friend
RELATED[2:friend]: name:Third Friend               # Third friend
```

The indexing follows this pattern:
- First item: `RELATED[type]`
- Second item: `RELATED[1:type]`
- Third item: `RELATED[2:type]`
- And so on...

**Important**: The order is deterministic - relationships are sorted first by key, then by value, ensuring consistent serialization and preventing unnecessary changes.

#### Genderless Relationship Types

Relationship types are stored in their genderless form in frontmatter, vCard files, and the relationship graph:

- Use `parent` (not mother/father)
- Use `child` (not son/daughter)
- Use `sibling` (not brother/sister)
- Use `aunt-uncle` (rendered as aunt/uncle based on gender)

Gender is only applied when rendering the Related list in markdown based on the contact's GENDER field.

### Gender Support

The plugin supports the vCard 4.0 GENDER field with four values:

```yaml
GENDER: M     # Male
GENDER: F     # Female  
GENDER: NB    # Non-binary
GENDER: U     # Unspecified (or Unknown)
```

When GENDER is NB, U, blank, or not present, the plugin renders relationships using genderless terms:
- `parent` (instead of mother/father)
- `child` (instead of son/daughter)
- `sibling` (instead of brother/sister)
- `aunt-uncle` (instead of aunt/uncle)

When GENDER is M or F, relationships are rendered with gender-specific terms in the Related list.

### Photo Support

```yaml
PHOTO: http://example.com/photo.jpg  # URL
PHOTO: /path/to/local/photo.jpg      # Local file
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use UIDs**: Always include a unique UID for each contact (UUID format preferred)
2. **Update REV**: The plugin automatically updates REV timestamps when contact data changes
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent file naming conventions matching contact display names
4. **Type Labels**: Use appropriate type labels for categorization
5. **Backup Data**: The vCard format ensures your data is portable
6. **Genderless Types**: Store relationship types in genderless form in frontmatter and vCard files
7. **UID References**: Prefer `urn:uuid:` namespace for RELATED fields when UIDs are UUIDs

## Import/Export

The plugin can:

- **Import** from any vCard 4.0 compliant file
- **Export** to standard .vcf files compatible with other systems
- **Sync** bidirectionally with external contact sources

This ensures your contact data remains accessible and portable across different platforms and applications.
