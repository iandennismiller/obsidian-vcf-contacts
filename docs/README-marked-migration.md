## üéØ Quick Summary

### The Problem
The codebase has **~94 regex operations** in `/src/models/contactNote` for markdown parsing, creating:
- Maintenance burden (custom edge case handling)
- Code duplication (heading detection in 3 places)
- Testing overhead (15-20 edge case tests)
- Repeated constants (50+ occurrences)

### The Solution
Use the `marked` library for standard markdown parsing:
- **What marked handles:** Headings, lists, whitespace, line breaks, paragraphs
- **What stays custom:** Wiki-links, field detection, relationship parsing, VCard mapping

### The Impact
- **Code reduction:** 200-350 lines (4-8%)
- **Regex reduction:** ~50 operations (47-57%)
- **Test reduction:** 15-20 edge case tests
- **Better maintainability:** Less custom code, more standards compliance

### The Plan
**3-week phased approach:**
- Week 1: Constants, utilities, first method
- Week 2: Section detection, list parsing
- Week 3: Test cleanup, optional class consolidation

### The Risk
**Low risk** with proper mitigation:
- ‚úÖ Phased approach
- ‚úÖ Extensive testing
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes
- ‚úÖ Clear rollback strategy

## üöÄ How to Use These Documents

### If you're a stakeholder or manager:
1. Read **`EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-marked-migration.md`**
2. Review the recommendation and next steps
3. Approve or discuss with the team

### If you're a developer planning the work:
1. Start with **`EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-marked-migration.md`** for context
2. Read **`refactoring-opportunities.md`** for the task list
3. Reference **`marked-migration-analysis.md`** for detailed technical info
4. Keep **`code-location-reference.md`** open while coding

### If you're implementing the changes:
1. Follow the migration checklist in **`refactoring-opportunities.md`**
2. Use **`code-location-reference.md`** to find exact code locations
3. Refer to **`marked-migration-analysis.md`** for code examples
4. Follow the verification checklist after each change

## üîç What's In Each Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- **Create** `markdownConstants.ts` with centralized constants
- **Create** `markedUtils.ts` with marked-based utilities
- **Replace** `extractMarkdownSections()` in markdownOperations.ts
- **Update** test helpers in curatorPipelineIntegration.spec.ts

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring (Week 2)
- **Replace** section detection in contactSectionOperations.ts
- **Replace** section detection in relationshipOperations.ts
- **Replace** list parsing structure (keep domain logic)
- **Update** all references to use new utilities

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Week 3)
- **Remove** markdown edge case tests
- **Add** marked integration tests
- **Consider** class consolidation (optional)
- **Update** documentation

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Performance similar or better
- [ ] Demo data files parse correctly
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] At least 200 lines of code removed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### This is PLANNING STAGE only
**No code changes have been made.** These documents provide analysis and roadmap for future work.

### What Marked CANNOT Replace
The analysis clearly identifies domain-specific logic that must remain custom:
- Obsidian wiki-links (`[[Contact]]`)
- Email/phone/URL pattern detection
- Relationship type parsing
- Gender-aware relationship terms
- VCard field mapping

### Backward Compatibility
All changes must maintain compatibility with:
- Existing contact notes
- Demo data files
- Public API
- Obsidian plugin interface

## ü§ù Contributing to the Migration

If you're working on the migration:

1. **Follow the phased approach** - don't skip ahead
2. **Test after each change** - run full test suite
3. **Verify demo data** - ensure all demo files still work
4. **Update documentation** - keep docs in sync with code
5. **Ask questions** - refer to analysis docs or ask the team
