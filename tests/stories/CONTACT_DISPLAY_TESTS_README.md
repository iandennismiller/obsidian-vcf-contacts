## Summary

- **Total Test Files:** 11
- **Total Tests:** 101
- **User Stories Covered:** 30-40 (11 user stories)
- **All Tests:** âœ… Passing

## Test Structure

All tests follow the existing pattern in the repository:
1. Use Vitest testing framework
2. Mock Obsidian App and Vault APIs
3. Use ContactNote model for operations
4. Include descriptive comments explaining future implementation
5. Test both current state and expected future behavior

## Notes

These tests serve as **integration tests** that define the expected behavior for the Contact Information Display feature. They are currently testing the foundational data structures (frontmatter fields) and will guide future implementation of:

1. Contact section generation from frontmatter
2. Contact section parsing to frontmatter
3. Fuzzy template system for bidirectional conversion
4. Curator processors for automatic synchronization
5. Template customization in settings
6. Validation and error handling
7. VCF integration
8. Performance optimizations

All tests include inline comments describing future implementation steps, making them serve as both tests and specifications for the feature.
