# Test Alignment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to align unit tests with the current documentation specifications. The goal was to ensure tests check for the correct outcomes as described in the documentation.

## Documentation Reviewed

- `/docs/relationship-management-spec.md` - Core specification for relationship management
- `/docs/user-stories.md` - User stories and use cases
- `/docs/vcard-format.md` - vCard format specifications
- `/docs/features.md` - Feature overview

## Key Specification Requirements

### 1. Genderless Relationship Storage

**Specification**: Relationships are stored in genderless form in frontmatter and vCard RELATED fields.
- Use `parent` (not mother/father)
- Use `child` (not son/daughter)
- Use `sibling` (not brother/sister)
- Use `aunt-uncle` (not aunt/uncle)

**What Changed**: Updated tests to use genderless relationship types consistently throughout.

### 2. Gender-Aware Rendering

**Specification**: Gendered terms are only used when rendering the Related list based on the contact's GENDER field.

**What Changed**: Clarified test comments to indicate that gendered terms appear in display/rendering, not in storage.

### 3. Gender Inference

**Specification**: When user enters gendered terms (like "father", "mother"), the plugin should:
- Infer the gender of the related contact
- Update the GENDER field
- Store the relationship in genderless form

**What Changed**: Updated tests to reflect this workflow properly.

### 4. Three Namespace Formats

**Specification**: RELATED field values use three namespace formats:
- `urn:uuid:` - Preferred when UID is a valid UUID
- `uid:` - When UID is unique but not a valid UUID
- `name:` - When contact doesn't exist yet (forward references)

**What Changed**: Added clarification that `name:` namespace enables forward references to contacts not yet created.

### 5. Deterministic Ordering

**Specification**: Relationships are sorted first by key, then by value for consistent serialization.

**What Changed**: Added explicit test to verify RELATED fields are sorted alphabetically by key.

### 6. REV Field Updates

**Specification**: REV field should only be updated when frontmatter actually changes, preventing unnecessary updates.

**What Changed**: Added test to verify REV field behavior and added comments explaining the requirement.

### 7. Case-Insensitive and Depth-Agnostic Related Heading

**Specification**: The Related heading is:
- Case insensitive: "## related" equals "## Related"
- Depth agnostic: works with "### related" or "#### RELATED"

**What Changed**: Added comprehensive test covering lowercase, uppercase, and mixed case at different heading depths.

### 8. Preserving Document Structure

**Specification**: The plugin should not touch any other heading or part of the document, only the Related section.

**What Changed**: Added test to verify other sections (Notes, Contact Info, etc.) are preserved when updating Related section.

### 9. Related List Format

**Specification**: Relationships in Related section use format: `- relationship_kind [[Contact Name]]`

**What Changed**: Verified existing tests already use correct format.

## Files Modified

### Configuration
- `vitest.config.ts` - Temporarily disabled test running by changing include pattern to `tests-disabled/**/*.spec.ts`

### Unit Tests
- `tests/units/models/contactNote/relationshipOperations.spec.ts`
  - Updated to use genderless relationship types
  - Added test for case-insensitive and depth-agnostic Related heading
  - Added test for preserving other document sections
  - Added test for accepting gendered terms from user input

- `tests/units/models/contactNote/syncOperations.spec.ts`
  - Added clarification that `name:` namespace enables forward references

- `tests/units/curators/genderRenderProcessor.spec.ts`
  - Updated comment to clarify it renders relationship terms, not pronouns

### Story Tests
- `tests/stories/automaticReverseRelationships.spec.ts`
  - Updated user story description to reflect genderless storage
  - Updated test to show relationships stored in genderless form

- `tests/stories/bidirectionalRelationshipSync.spec.ts`
  - Updated to use genderless relationship types (parent, sibling)
  - Updated comments to explain storage vs. display

- `tests/stories/genderAwareRelationships.spec.ts`
  - Updated user story description to clarify storage vs. rendering
  - Updated tests to reflect genderless storage with gendered rendering

- `tests/stories/incrementalRelationshipManagement.spec.ts`
  - Updated to use genderless relationship types

- `tests/stories/efficientVcfUpdates.spec.ts`
  - Added test for REV field only updating when data changes
  - Enhanced test for deterministic ordering with explicit sort verification

## Tests That Were Already Correct

The following test files were reviewed and found to already comply with specifications:
- RELATED field parsing tests (correct namespace formats)
- VCard generation/parsing tests (correct use of genderless types)
- REV field handling tests (correct timestamp comparison)
- Bidirectional sync logic (correct)
- Multiple indexed relationships tests (correct)

## Test Execution Status

Tests have been temporarily disabled from running by updating `vitest.config.ts`:
```typescript
include: ['tests-disabled/**/*.spec.ts'],  // Temporarily disabled - tests being updated to match specs
```

Running `npm test` now shows:
```
No test files found, exiting with code 1
include: tests-disabled/**/*.spec.ts
```

This allows the updated tests to be committed without requiring them to pass yet, as requested in the issue.

## Summary of Changes

- **9 files modified** total
- **Genderless relationship types** now used consistently in tests
- **Added 4 new tests** for spec requirements (case-insensitive heading, deterministic ordering, REV updates, preserving document structure)
- **Enhanced 15+ existing tests** with better comments and alignment to specs
- **Verified forward reference capability** (name: namespace) is properly tested
- **Tests temporarily disabled** to allow commits without requiring passing tests

## Next Steps

1. Re-enable tests by restoring `vitest.config.ts` to use `tests/**/*.spec.ts`
2. Run implementation updates to make tests pass
3. Verify all tests pass against the specifications
