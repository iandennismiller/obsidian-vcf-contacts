## Writing User Stories

User stories follow the format: **"As a user, I want... so that..."**

Each story should include:
- Clear description of the user need
- Expected behavior
- Test location (when applicable)
- Related specifications

User stories focus on **what** the user wants to accomplish, while specifications focus on **how** the system implements it.
